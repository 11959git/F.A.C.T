# F.A.C.T
Framework for Assisting the Creation of Training programs

This is a program that was made for a for a software programing class.
It is made with the intent of being used for writing training programs for AAC, as the alogorithm for searching is based around the lesson codes.
You will need to provide the database of lessons, complete with lesson names and codes. I am not providing them because I don't know if I would be breaching a confidentiallity clause. 
That being said, you can likely find them all on the clear web so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  .
Feel free to use as you see fit.
